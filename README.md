# 🎓 A Deep Learning Based Human Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi Signals
#### Major Project :

This project uses a Raspberry Pi and Wi-Fi router to collect Channel State Information (CSI) data, which tracks changes in Wi-Fi signals caused by human movements, to train a model that recognizes different human activities.

## Project Workflow

- **Hardware**: Integrating Hardware components for data collection.

- **Data Collection**: Collecting CSI data using Raspberry Pi(Rx) and Router(Tx).

- **Preprocessing**: Filtering and transforming the CSI data.

- **Visualization**: Visualizing the CSI data before and after preprocessing.

- **Feature Extraction and Annotation**: Extracting features from the preprocessed data and annotating the data for training.

- **Model Training**: Building model architecture and training the model to recognize different human activities.

- **UI**: Developing an application integrating all the components.
